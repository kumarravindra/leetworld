integer list  = [1,2,3,4]
String list = ["Ram","Shyam","Laxman"]
String, Integer, Float list = ['spam', 1, 2, 3.0, 4, 5.01]
List inside another list (String, integer, float, nested list) = ['spam', 2.0,5, [10,20]]
This is the difference between array and list, same list can have different types of data
